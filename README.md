# Stories.io: A simple way to manage your life using Agile.

The idea of user stories in agile can be applied to your personal life by setting goals in the form of stories that you tell yourself. 

Stories are your large goals like: "Start a new business". All stories have chapters and must be written by completing sub-tasks of the main story. Chapters are only "written" by completing specific actions and tasks. At the end of completing a goal, you'll have written a story that can be documented as a reminder of something you've accomplished in your life and that actual steps it took to complete!
