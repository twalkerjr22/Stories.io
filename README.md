# Stories.io: A simple way to manage your life using Agile.

The idea of user stories in agile can be applied to your personal life by setting goals in the form of stories that you tell yourself. 

Stories are your large goals like start a new business. This story will then have chapters and must be written. They can only be "written" by you actually living it and completing what needs to be done in this chapter! At the end of completing a goal you will essentially have written a story that can be documented as a reminder of something you've accomplished in your life and that actual steps it took to complete.
